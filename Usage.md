# Usage

A few nice to have's

- Git
- Node.js
- Lots of storage

Once you have all that downloaded, we can get started!

First we need to download the repository! Open `cmd`, and run this command!

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/PatheticMustan/ScoutingApp2019.git

cd ScoutingApp2019
```

Great! Now we need to install the dependencies our project relies on. Be warned, this will take a LONG time. It will also take lots of storage. As I'm writing this, `node_modules` takes ~300 MB, mostly from `expo-cli` and `react-native`.

```cmd
npm install
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Now to run the app, you can use the `loc` shortcut I prepared.

```cmd
expo start --tunnel
```

Great job! It should open a tab saying something about "(1) Scouting App on Expo Developer Tools", or "Metro Bundler".

Click on "Run in web browser", and wait for the app to pop up.

Tada, you're done!
